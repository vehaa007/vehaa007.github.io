        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Our goal is to come up with something interensting to write about omfg its 23:04 at night i might be up all night creating this how did my life end up like this i never wanted it to be this way. why couldn't i just do it the easy way and continued with the <a href="https://chronicallyonline.godaddysites.com/">old website</a> i feel so dumb right now i could have gotten away easy but the i thought to myselves "Hey wouldnt it be fun to make your own website from scratch, i think everyone will get so impressed by your skills", but the i realised that the skills turned out to be the friends we made along the way this is a nightmanre a nightmare a nightmare a nightmare a ninghtmare a nightmare i could contiue for another couple of hours but i think i have to do other shit right now, sorry i really only wrote this because this part has been empty for over a week, with no fucks given, btw if you read this far the login details are username "faithless" with the password "catsarebestpet", as a reference to the hacking game "HackNet OS" where a character har the same login details for their IRC channel (I cant remember what their IP was, but im sure you will find it, I got there in my first playthough, btw there is a stash at ip address 1337.1337.1337.1337 that you can connect to at any time, it has some really helpful tools, i would 100% reccomend it, but it sort of ruines the whole experience of the game) i have been witing this for about eight minutes already, so if you have read this far, do something else this text will not contain any further information except, of course i might come up with something more to reveal because i noticed that you can systematically connect to any computer on the school network by using the SKANBxxxx.osloskole.no (the xxxx would be 4 numbers, in my case 3454, i often have a webserver open on port 8008 i think, it is basically a remote control application but i fucked up when creating it so it does'nt really work) you can also find out someones local ip address by using that trick, but it doesnt really make any difference from just using the skanbxxx trik. i have even given out my ip address in my kahoot name, i am 10.71.168.154 i think im not sure i am at home so i cant check rn, another trick, if you want to find out an WIFI-networks password (one you have already connected to previously) you can use the command 'netsh wlan show profile [ WiFi name ] key="clear"' the scroll down until "key content" btw it doesnt work for the school wifi, i tried :( i think i am getting to the end of my creativity because i have written well over 2500 characters in about 16 minutes (some of you do the maths please) oh andi forgot about one feature completely if you do the konami code on almost any page, you will find a surprise, and if you dont remember the konami code it is up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter/start, so thats just a feature i decided to add to the site because i though it was cool. i would guess you have already tried it? what do you think of the spinning cube? i made it myselves, the rendering engine as well, just because i had too little to do a weekend. damn i have a sad life, but it might also be a symptom of ADHD, just doing som random shit and then losing motivation before starting something else immidiately. idgaf if i have ADHD or not and i will not be getting tested for it because i couldnt give less of a fuck. i know i wrote earlier that i was coming close to the end of my creativity, but it seems as if my creativity is more persistent that i thought. btw sorry for the attempted rickroll at the main page, i still dont know if i actually ended up doing it or not. if i did, i would like to give you my deepest apology if you really think it was an evil action. the sites name is a reference to me not having any idea what to make this page about, something that clearly continued when i began writing this. i would like to say that you have been reading this for an approximately 5 minutes or something, get back to work. most likely, noone else is reading this right now and i am effectivelly writing into a void. if you think that means i will reveal my deepest darkest sevrets, think again, i will probably just continue saying hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia until i die. did you know that "hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia" describes the phobia of really long words, or etymologically speaking the irrasional fear of as montorous as a hippopotomus-large words, yes the hippopoto actually references hippos. many people think hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is the largest word in the english dictionary, but this it not factually accurate. that title belongs to the word pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, which, just like hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia stems from latin. i have not made really that much research into pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis as hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, but i am sure there is a really good reason that it is that large. a common misspelling of hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is "hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia", and it is so subtle that i didnt even realise they were different, but the difference is that "quipe" has an extra "p" in the misspelt version, causing it to be one character longer than hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia. if you want to read more about this word, you can go to wikitionary, i think its https://wikitionary.org or https://dictionairy.wikipedia.org or something like that. i just looked it up and its https://www.wiktionary.org/ just search up hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia and youll find the article right away. i just noticed there is a page made by the wikipedia guys called "Wikiquote" and it lets you find random people with the weirdest quotes ever, like "Naïve you are, if you believe, life favours those, who arent naïve". lol that was from the page of Naivety https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Naivety seems like the person who said that was called Piet Hein. i have actually wrote for 40 minutes straight now, i would love if this was the english tentamen (idk what it is in english and i dont care enough to look it up) btw what do you think of the buttons i created for this site, i am really happy how they turned out, but i would love someone elses oppinion on the matter. i think thats it. thanks for reading this far. sorry if it destroyed you sleep scedule, i know it destroyed mine. its currently 23:47 november 19 2022, and i want to be done with this dick of a website befor monday, but im not sure it will end up happening or not. if you check the html by inspecting element, you can see that i acctually wrote this whole thing on one line. if you read this far, find something better to do with your life, please. well actually when i reloaded the page, i found out it wasnt even really that close to being two pages long. so i figured i can write a bit longer. i have no idea what i am doing with my life. i might just insert a random picture of obama or something here <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTsALI8yb3fP0oQD6M8zaUpqXxmSQa-VlwKLQ&usqp=CAU">BOOM suprise obama, and no this is not social commentary i just didnt find anything else to use this space for. what did you think of the picture? i really just picked a random picture from the internet when i searched for "obama png" and i ended up with this garbage, and it isnt even a .png image. i got scammed heavily by the google search engine, i might switch to duckduckgo, wait no their image search sucks more ass than your mother, so i dont think that would have resulted in any better things. i have successfully been eriting this shit for almost an hour now and i really want to quit but i dont feel like i can because every time i want to i just come up with more things to write about, like hoe im almost at 10000 characters, but i will not reach that far. fuck that i want to sleep, even tho i wont be able to sleep until probably 4 am or something. bye thanks for reading this shit all the way until the end its currently 00:03 th 20th november and i dont give a shit about doing it until its 00:04 "just so i can say i did it the whole hour" fuck that im going to bed.</p>
